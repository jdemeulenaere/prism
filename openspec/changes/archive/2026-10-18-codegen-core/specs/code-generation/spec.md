# Code Generation Specification

## Purpose

The code generation specification defines the Tier 1 backend: how the elaborated MIR of each file is compiled into native code in memory, which constructs the backend compiles today and how it rejects the others, how generated functions are named and called, and how values are represented. What a running program does is the `execution` spec's.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tier 1 Compiles Elaborated MIR in Memory
`prism run` MUST compile the elaborated MIR of every file of the program into native code in the memory of the `prism` process, without invoking any external program such as a linker or an assembler. Every body MUST be compiled except generic bodies, which wait for monomorphization, and closure bodies, which wait for closure conversion.

#### Scenario: Running a scalar program
- **WHEN** `fun square(x: Int): Int = x * x` and `fun main() { println(square(7)) }` are declared in `main.prism` and `prism run main.prism` runs
- **THEN** it prints `49` and exits with status 0, and no other process is started

#### Scenario: An uncalled generic function is not compiled
- **WHEN** `fun <T> keep(x: T): T = x` and `fun main() { println(1) }` are declared and `prism run main.prism` runs
- **THEN** it prints `1` and exits with status 0

### Requirement: One Code Unit per File
Each file MUST be compiled into its own code unit from its own elaborated MIR alone. A code unit MUST refer to the functions and top-level values of other files only by their symbols, so that its code does not depend on how those files are compiled.

#### Scenario: Compiling independent source files
- **WHEN** a program has an entry file `app/main.prism` importing `/lib/math`
- **THEN** each of the two files is code-generated as a standalone unit, and `prism dump-clif app/main.prism` names the functions of `lib/math` only by their symbols

### Requirement: Symbols Derive from Declaration Paths
Every compiled function MUST have a symbol derived from its declaration's identity alone: `<module>::<name>` for a function, `<module>::<receiver>.<name>` for an extension, where the receiver is written as the ABI writes its type constructor, `<function symbol>#default(<parameter>)` for a default value's generator, and `<module>::<name>#init` and `<module>::<name>#get` for a top-level `val`'s initializer and accessor. Symbols MUST be unique in a program.

#### Scenario: Symbols of a file
- **WHEN** `lib/math.prism`, in package `lib`, declares `public fun Int.double(): Int = this * 2`, `public fun scale(a: Int, b: Int = 2): Int = a * b` and `public val BASE: Int = 3`
- **THEN** `prism dump-clif lib/math.prism` prints the functions `lib/math::Int.double`, `lib/math::scale`, `lib/math::scale#default(b)`, `lib/math::BASE#init` and `lib/math::BASE#get`

### Requirement: Calls Go Through the Function Table
Every call of a top-level function, extension, default value generator or top-level `val` accessor, in the same file or another, MUST load its target from the callee's slot in a process-wide function table and call it indirectly. A slot MUST keep its address for the life of the process, and a slot whose function is not linked MUST hold a stub that ends the program with a runtime error. No call MUST be inlined.

#### Scenario: Calls within and across files are indirect
- **WHEN** `app/main.prism` imports `/lib/math`, which declares `public fun twice(n: Int): Int = n * 2`, and declares `fun helper(): Int = 1` and `fun main() { println(twice(helper())) }`
- **THEN** `prism dump-clif app/main.prism` shows each of the two calls in `main` as a load from the callee's slot followed by an indirect call, and `prism run app/main.prism` prints `2`

#### Scenario: Recursive calls
- **WHEN** `fun fact(n: Int): Int = if (n <= 1) 1 else n * fact(n - 1)` and `fun main() { println(fact(20)) }` run
- **THEN** the program prints `2432902008176640000`

### Requirement: Scalar Values Are Represented Natively
An `Int` MUST be a 64-bit integer, a `Double` a 64-bit IEEE 754 float, a `Bool` a byte holding 0 or 1, a `Char` a 32-bit Unicode scalar value, and a reference a pointer. `Unit` and `Nothing` MUST have no representation: a `Unit` parameter or result is left out of a function's signature, and a function returning `Nothing` has no result. Functions MUST use the host platform's C calling convention.

#### Scenario: Signatures of scalar functions
- **WHEN** `fun f(n: Int, b: Bool, c: Char, d: Double, r: &Int): Double = d` and `fun g(n: Int) {}` are declared and `prism dump-clif main.prism` runs
- **THEN** `f` takes a 64-bit integer, an 8-bit integer, a 32-bit integer, a 64-bit float and a pointer and returns a 64-bit float, and `g` takes a 64-bit integer and returns nothing

### Requirement: References to Scalars
A shared or mutable reference whose referent the backend supports MUST point at the borrowed place itself: borrowing a local MUST keep that local in memory for as long as its storage lives and give its address, and reading or writing through a reference MUST read or write the referent.

#### Scenario: Writing through a mutable reference
- **WHEN** `fun bump(r: &mut Int) { *r = r + 1 }` is declared and `fun main() { var n = 1; bump(&mut n); bump(&mut n); println(n) }` runs
- **THEN** the program prints `3`

#### Scenario: Default value reading an earlier argument
- **WHEN** `fun f(a: Int, b: Int = a + 1): Int = a * b` is declared and `fun main() { println(f(3)); println(f(3, 5)) }` runs
- **THEN** the program prints `12` and then `15`

### Requirement: Top-Level Values Have Storage and an Accessor
Each top-level `val` MUST have storage in its file's code unit and an accessor that initializes the storage on its first call, as the `execution` spec defines, and returns its address. A read of a top-level `val`, in its own file or another, MUST call the accessor through the function table.

#### Scenario: Reading an imported top-level value
- **WHEN** `lib/config.prism` declares `public val LIMIT: Int = 10`, and `app/main.prism` imports `/lib/config` and declares `fun main() { println(LIMIT + 1) }`
- **THEN** `prism run app/main.prism` prints `11`

### Requirement: Unsupported Constructs Are Rejected Before Code Generation
Before generating any code, the backend MUST check every body it compiles and report `E6001` (`UnsupportedByBackend`) for the first construct of each body that it does not support, naming the construct. An unsupported parameter or return type MUST be reported at the declaration, anything else at the first statement or terminator using it, in block order. A rejected program MUST NOT run. `prism check` MUST NOT report `E6001`.

#### Scenario: A struct is rejected
- **WHEN** `struct P { val x: Int }` and `fun main() { val p = P(1); println(p.x) }` are declared
- **THEN** `prism check main.prism` passes, and `prism run main.prism` reports `E6001` at `P(1)`, naming structs, prints nothing to stdout and exits with status 1

#### Scenario: Unsupported constructs in several forms
- **WHEN** a program's `main` runs `println("hi")`, or `val n: Int? = null`, or `val f = { 1 }`, or `println(id(1))` for `fun <T> id(x: T): T = x`, or the program declares `compose fun Label() {}` or `fun first(s: String): Int = 1`
- **THEN** `prism run` reports `E6001` naming strings at `"hi"`, nullable values at `null`, closures at `{ 1 }`, calls of generic functions at `id(1)`, composable functions at `Label`, and strings at the declaration of `first`, and runs nothing

#### Scenario: One error per body
- **WHEN** `fun f(): Int { val a = "x"; val b = "y"; return 1 }` and `fun g(): Int { val c = "z"; return 2 }` are declared with a `main` that calls neither
- **THEN** `prism run` reports exactly two `E6001`, one at `"x"` in `f` and one at `"z"` in `g`

### Requirement: Cranelift IR Dump
`prism dump-clif <file.prism>` MUST print, as deterministic text, the Cranelift IR of each function the backend generates for the file, in body order, each headed by its symbol. Like `prism dump-mir --elaborated`, it MUST compile the file alone, against its direct imports' ABIs. When the file has errors of any stage, including `E6001`, it MUST report them, print no IR, and exit with a failure status.

#### Scenario: Dumping a file's IR
- **WHEN** `prism dump-clif main.prism` runs twice on a file that `prism run` accepts
- **THEN** it prints the same text both times and exits with status 0

#### Scenario: Dumping a file the backend rejects
- **WHEN** `prism dump-clif main.prism` runs on a file holding `fun f(s: String): Int = 1`
- **THEN** it reports `E6001`, prints no IR, and exits with a failure status
